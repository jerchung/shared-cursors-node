This is a random side-project I made using node.js and socket.io
The position of the mouse cursor of everyone currently connected to the page is visible on each client's browser window

Heroku currently does not support websockets, so instead I used xhr long-polling so it may be a bit slow.

Open multiple windows to test.  Mouse cursor is by an image of a cursor
